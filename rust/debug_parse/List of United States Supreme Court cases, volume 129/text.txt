{{see also|List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States by court composition}}

The Supreme Court is established by [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III, Section 1]] of the [[Constitution of the United States]], which says: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court . . .". The size of the Court is not specified; the Constitution leaves it to [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] to set the number of justices. Under the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] Congress originally fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/supreme_court|title=Supreme Court Research Guide |access-date=7 April 2021 |publisher=Georgetown Law Library}}</ref> Since 1789 Congress has varied the size of the Court from six to [[Seventh Circuit Act of 1807|seven]], [[Eighth and Ninth Circuits Act of 1837|nine]], [[Tenth Circuit Act of 1863|ten]], and back to [[Judiciary Act of 1869|nine]] justices (always including one chief justice).

When the cases in volume 129 U.S. were decided the Court comprised the following nine members:

==Notable Case in 129 U.S.==
===''Dent v. West Virginia''===
In ''[[Dent v. West Virginia]]'', [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/92392/dent-v-west-virginia       129 U.S. 114 (1889)], the Supreme Court upheld a state [[Medical license|physician licensing law]]. A practitioner with insufficient credentials to obtain a medical license sued West Virginia, claiming a violation of his rights under the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. The Supreme Court upheld the statute noting that, while each citizen had a right to follow any lawful calling, they were subject to reasonable state restrictions. Because of the nature of medical training, the large amount of knowledge required, and the life-and-death circumstances with which physicians dealt, patients needed to rely on the assurance of a license requiring physicians to meet a minimum set of standards.

Under the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] the federal court structure at the time comprised District Courts, which had general trial jurisdiction; Circuit Courts, which had mixed trial and appellate (from the US District Courts) jurisdiction; and the United States Supreme Court, which had appellate jurisdiction over the federal District and Circuit courts—and for certain issues over state courts. The Supreme Court also had limited [[original jurisdiction]] (''i.e.,'' in which cases could be filed directly with the Supreme Court without first having been heard by a lower federal or state court). There were one or more federal District Courts and/or Circuit Courts in each state, territory, or other geographical region.
