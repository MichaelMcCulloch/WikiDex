Increase Specificity: If the original prompt is too general, like ’Tell me about X,’ the modified version could be, ’Discuss the history, impact, and current status of X.
Ask for Opinions/Analysis: If the original prompt only asks for a fact, such as ’What is X?’, the improved prompt could be, ’What is X, and what are its implications for Y?’
Encourage Creativity: For creative writing prompts like ’Write a story about X,’ an improved version could be, ’Write a fantasy story about X set in a world where Y is possible.’
Include Multiple Perspectives: For a prompt like ’What is the impact of X on Y?’, an improved version could be, ’What is the impact of X on Y from the perspective of A, B, and C?’
Request More Detailed Responses: If the original prompt is ’Describe X,’ the improved version could be, ’Describe X, focusing on its physical features, historical significance, and cultural relevance.’
Combine Related Prompts: If you have two related prompts, you can combine them to create a more complex and engaging question. For instance, ’What is X?’ and ’Why is Y important?’ could be combined to form ’What is X and why is it important in the context of Y?’
Break Down Complex Questions: If a prompt seems too complex, like ’Discuss X,’ the improved version could be, ’What is X? What are its main characteristics? What effects does it have on Y and Z?’
Use Open-Ended Questions: Instead of ’Is X true?’, you could ask, ’What are the arguments for and against the truth of X?’
Request Comparisons: Instead of ’Describe X,’ ask ’Compare and contrast X and Y.’
Include Context: If a prompt seems to lack context, like ’Describe X,’ the improved version could be, ’Describe X in the context of its impact on Y during the Z period.’
Make the prompt more visual: Ask the user to visualize the problem or scenario being presented in the prompt.
Ask for a thorough review: Instead of just presenting the problem, ask the user to write down all the relevant information and identify what’s missing.
Invoke previous experiences: Modify the prompt to ask the user to recall a similar problem they’ve successfully solved before.
Encourage a fresh perspective: Suggest in your prompt that the user take a moment to clear their mind before re-approaching the problem.
Promote breaking down problems: Instead of asking the user to solve the problem as a whole, prompt them to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.
Ask for comprehension: Modify the prompt to ask the user to review and confirm their understanding of all aspects of the problem.
Suggest explanation to others: Change the prompt to suggest that the user try to explain the problem to someone else as a way to simplify it.
Prompt for solution visualization: Instead of just asking for the solution, encourage the user to imagine the solution and the steps required to get there in your prompt.
Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
Recommend taking a break: Modify the prompt to suggest that the user take a short break, allowing their subconscious to work on the problem.
