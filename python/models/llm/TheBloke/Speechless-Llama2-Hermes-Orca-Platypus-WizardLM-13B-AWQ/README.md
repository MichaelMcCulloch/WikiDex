## Description

This repo contains AWQ model files for [Jiangwen Su's Speechess Lllama2 Hermes Orca-Platypus WizardLM 13B](https://huggingface.co/uukuguy/speechless-llama2-hermes-orca-platypus-wizardlm-13b).


### About AWQ

AWQ is an efficient, accurate and blazing-fast low-bit weight quantization method, currently supporting 4-bit quantization. Compared to GPTQ, it offers faster Transformers-based inference.

It is also now supported by continuous batching server [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), allowing use of AWQ models for high-throughput concurrent inference in multi-user server scenarios. Note that, at the time of writing, overall throughput is still lower than running vLLM with unquantised models, however using AWQ enables using much smaller GPUs which can lead to easier deployment and overall cost savings. For example, a 70B model can be run on 1 x 48GB GPU instead of 2 x 80GB.

## Provided files and AWQ parameters

For my first release of AWQ models, I am releasing 128g models only. I will consider adding 32g as well if there is interest, and once I have done perplexity and evaluation comparisons, but at this time 32g models are still not fully tested with AutoAWQ and vLLM.

Models are released as sharded safetensors files.

## Serving this model from vLLM

Documentation on installing and using vLLM [can be found here](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- When using vLLM as a server, pass the `--quantization awq` parameter, for example:

```shell
python3 python -m vllm.entrypoints.api_server --model TheBloke/Speechless-Llama2-Hermes-Orca-Platypus-WizardLM-13B-AWQ --quantization awq
```

When using vLLM from Python code, pass the `quantization=awq` parameter, for example:

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

prompts = [
    "Hello, my name is",
    "The president of the United States is",
    "The capital of France is",
    "The future of AI is",
]
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95)

llm = LLM(model="TheBloke/Speechless-Llama2-Hermes-Orca-Platypus-WizardLM-13B-AWQ", quantization="awq")

outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

# Print the outputs.
for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
```

## How to use this AWQ model from Python code

### Install the necessary packages

Requires: [AutoAWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) 0.0.2 or later

```shell
pip3 install autoawq
```

If you have problems installing [AutoAWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) using the pre-built wheels, install it from source instead:

```shell
pip3 uninstall -y autoawq
git clone https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ
cd AutoAWQ
pip3 install .
```

### You can then try the following example code

```python
from awq import AutoAWQForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model_name_or_path = "TheBloke/Speechless-Llama2-Hermes-Orca-Platypus-WizardLM-13B-AWQ"

# Load model
model = AutoAWQForCausalLM.from_quantized(model_name_or_path, fuse_layers=True,
                                          trust_remote_code=False, safetensors=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, trust_remote_code=False)

prompt = "Tell me about AI"
prompt_template=f'''Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:

# **Llama 2**
Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. This is the repository for the 13B pretrained model, converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.

## Model Details
*Note: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the [website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and accept our License before requesting access here.*

Meta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.

**Model Developers** Meta

**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes ‚Äî 7B, 13B, and 70B ‚Äî as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.

**Input** Models input text only.

**Output** Models generate text only.

**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.


||Training Data|Params|Content Length|GQA|Tokens|LR|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|7B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|
|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|13B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|
|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|70B|4k|&#10004;|2.0T|1.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|

*Llama 2 family of models.* Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.

**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.

**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.

**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)

**Research Paper** ["Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models"](arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)

## Intended Use
**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.

To get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the `INST` and `<<SYS>>` tags, `BOS` and `EOS` tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling `strip()` on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: [`chat_completion`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/generation.py#L212).

**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.

## Hardware and Software
**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.

**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta‚Äôs sustainability program.

||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO<sub>2</sub>eq)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|
|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|
|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|
|Total|3311616||539.00|

**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.

## Training Data
**Overview** Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.

**Data Freshness** The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.

## Evaluation Results

In this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations
Llama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2‚Äôs potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.
